           <div class="about-me__body">
               <p>I was first introduced to programming in middle school from my older brother, who would show me the projects he created. 
                I was instantly hooked and started learning everything I could about it. I have always followed in my brother's footsteps, 
                and I love the challenge and problem-solving that computer science provides me with. I also get a great sense of satisfaction 
                from seeing my programs succeed from start to finish.</p>

               <p>Gaming has been a major hobby of mine since I was a kid. I have fond memories of staying up late playing games with my brother 
                or friends. My love of programming was influenced by gaming, as I began my journey into it by developing games at a young age. 
                Aside from programming, I've always been passionate about sports, whether it's soccer, basketball, or snowboarding. I also enjoy 
                exploring. I am very family- and friend-oriented, and I enjoy going on adventures with them. This could include hiking, traveling, 
                and trying new food spots.</p>
